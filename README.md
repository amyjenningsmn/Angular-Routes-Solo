#Angular-Routes-Solo
Hey everybody!

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3 political candidates of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the candidates. This should be served from Node and Express as a full stack application.



Sample candidates:

- Bernie Sanders

- Hilary Clinton

- Martin O'Malley

- Marco Rubio

- Donald Trump

- Ted Cruz



Feel free to use Google for the content, or make up your own!
